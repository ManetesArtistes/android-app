# ManetesArtistes - Android Application

**ManetesArtistes** is an Android application combining two exciting game modes: the classic Simon Says memory game and creative coloring pages. Designed for children aged 2 to 5 years, this app encourages both cognitive skill development and creative expression in an engaging and child-friendly environment.

## Features

- **Two Game Modes**:
  - **Simon Says**: A memory game that challenges children to follow and replicate sequences of colors and sounds.
  - **Coloring Pages**: Predefined shapes and illustrations that children can color, allowing them to explore their creativity.
- **Main Menu Navigation**: Easy-to-use main menu for selecting either the Simon Says game or the coloring pages.
- **Child-Friendly Interface**: Large buttons, minimal text, and intuitive icons to ensure an enjoyable experience for toddlers and young children.
- **Progress Tracking**: Integration with a desktop application to track and manage children's progress across both game modes.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Android SDK, Jetpack Compose for UI components, Coroutines for asynchronous tasks.
- **Minimum SDK**: Android API level 24 (Android 7.0)
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for better separation of concerns.

## Getting Started

## Usage

- **Before Starting**: Let the child choose their favorite sticker from the available options (20 in total). Once chosen, let the child stick it on their hand or anywhere they like (e.g., on their face, arm, etc.).
- **Login**: Launch the app and have the child select the sticker they chose previously as their user photo.
- **Before Playing**: Write down somewhere safe the association between the child's name and their chosen sticker to avoid losing track.

- **Coloring Pages**: Choose from a variety of shapes and illustrations, then color them using different brushes and colors.
